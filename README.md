# Megaman X SNES remake

MMX - Remade an SNES game

This a version of Megaman X for the SNES that I made in Unity, I tried to re-create as many mechanics from the original game as I could, I imported all the animations and all the sprites into the game along with a couple of the enemies found in the original game.
